QnA model

Generative AI encompasses technologies that generate text, images, or audio. A subset of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), focuses specifically on text generation. In the realm of Question and Answer (QnA) models, there are two primary types: extractive and abstractive. Extractive models retrieve answers directly from the source documents, while abstractive models generate answers based on the context, creating responses that may not directly appear in the source material.
